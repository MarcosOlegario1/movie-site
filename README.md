How to try load this project...

 - I used ddev but I couldn't efficiently replicate the load as a new machine, if you use another format to run drupal locally, inside the "how-to" folder you have the database and the configuration file.

- For all intents and purposes, this project was done in less than 7 hours of execution due to the need for time and the combination of the lack of experience in the CMS, it will still be fixed and restructured the way it should be.


Summary of what exists and has been configured:

 - Created subtheme;
 - Added Movies and Actors relationship who acted in each movie;
 - Added Actors and relationship of the movies each actor acted in;

Tasks not to be performed:

 - Create page for the Actors;
 - Create movies page;
 - Stylized Home with Featured Movies;
 - Styling the sub-theme by applying a layout with better visibility to the site;

What was left in the middle:
 - Actor and Film search field was created and it works in the admin but I couldn't insert the field in the site layout;
